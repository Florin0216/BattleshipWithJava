This is a console project based on hyperskill.org project "Battleship" using Java.Description of this project : There are different variations of the Battleship game, but we will stick to the original rules written by Milton Bradley. You have a 10Ã—10 game field and five ships to arrange on that field. The ships can be placed horizontally or vertically but not diagonally across the grid spaces; the ships should not cross or touch each other. The goal is to sink all the ships of the opponent before your opponent does this to you.
